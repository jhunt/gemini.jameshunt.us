# jameshunt.us

Welcome, fellow Gemini nerds, to my gemlog.

I also have an HTTP site:

=> https://jameshunt.us

and I run an HTTP -> Gemini proxy, for the public benefit:

=> https://gemini.zyxl.xyz/

I'm also on Twitter, @iamjameshunt, and my code is (mostly) all on GitHub.

## ./gemlog

These are random thoughts and musings.  Sometimes I just need to ramble.
