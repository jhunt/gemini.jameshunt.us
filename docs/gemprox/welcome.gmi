# Welcome to Gemini!

Hello there.

This is gemprox, also known as gemini.zyxl.xyz (prounounced zixl-dot-ziz).  It's a gateway from the HTTP Web into Gemini space, where the written word rules and text is still in fashion.

## Where to Go

Here's a set of sites I regularly read and/or write

=> gemini://jameshunt.us/log           My Gemlog (over at jameshunt.us)

=> gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space   The protocol / spec for Gemini itself

=> gemini://rawtext.club/~sloum/spacewalk.gmi   SPACEWALK (an aggregator)
